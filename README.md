# CS-230-Operating-Platforms

### Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
> The fictional client, The Gaming Room, is a gaming company that wished to extend their game Draw It or Lose It to multiple operating systems. Draw It or Lose It is a multiplayer game where two teams had to guess the answers to image puzzles within a certain time. The Gaming Room did not have the necessary knowledge to develop a web-based version of the game as it exists on Android currently and wished for my fictional company, Creative Technology Solutions, to do the development for them.

### What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
> I think I did particularly well in the operating system evaluation table.

### What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
> Working through this document helped to fully flesh out the idea for the software and the architecture necessary to develop it to the needs of the customer.

### If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
> If I could revise one part of this document, it would be the Recommendations section. I believe I could have done a better job by providing more detail to better support my statements.

### How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
> I fully considered all the requirements laid out by the user and made informed decisions to support their needs by making recommendations on the architecture and the operating system. It is extremely important to consider the user's needs because they are the whole reason we are designing the software in the first place. They are the customer and they define the parameters by which they must have software. If we accept the project asked for by the user, we commit to providing a solution that will satisfy their needs.

### How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
> I took the time to fully understand the needs of the user, researched the best solution to fit the needs of the user, and designed software architecture that would meet all of those needs as effectively as possible. I will use a similar process every time I design software.
